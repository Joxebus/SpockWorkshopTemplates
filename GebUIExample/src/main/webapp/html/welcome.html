    <h1>Functional programming with Spock and Geb</h1>
    <p id="content" style="font-size: 20px">
        This application is a simple web interface.<br/><br/>

        It is used as an example for <a href="http://www.gebish.org/">Geb</a> tests. Although it is created with <a href="http://spring.io/">Spring</a>, it could
        actually use any technology, as functional tests with Spock/Geb treat the system as a black box.<br/><br/>

        The code was created strictly for illustration purposes. A production ready application would have many more details and error checking.
